**Tipsy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Rishabh TEwari**

Time spent: **3.5** hours spent in total (Made two iterations of a tip calculator app + The presentation

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added a feature to split the bill if multiple people are eating together
- [X] Added two different ways to adjust the tip.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* My attempt at trying to build an app with SwiftUI initially which would have taken way longer as that's something new to me before switching over to the Storyboards approach.
* Dealing with multiple screen sizes.
* Dealing with the ocassional Xcode bugs and crashes.
* Me disliking my color scheme, and then accidentally losing the codebase. (Commit frequently!). Made two iterations of the app
* Trying to figure out why the GIF wouldn't embed before realizing it's an MP4.
